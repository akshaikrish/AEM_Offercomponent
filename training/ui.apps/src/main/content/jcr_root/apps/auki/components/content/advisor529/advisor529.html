                    <h2>Open a 529 savings plan</h2>
                    <p>Work with your financial advisor to open a CollegeAmerica 529 savings plan. He or she will help
                        you to understand your choices and choose the best investment option for your family. Plus,
                        working with a professional may give you some extra time to spend with your favorite people â€”
                        your kids. If you don't have a financial advisor, you can use our tool to find one.</p><a
